# Soundboard
Basic Java soundboard implementation.

Uses FFMpeg (in local directory) to convert any files located within /Sounds to .wav format, which is required for playback.

This Soundboard requires a Virtual Audio Cable interface, which you must install.
I suggest this one: http://vbaudio.jcedeveloppement.com/Download_CABLE/VBCABLE_Driver_Pack43.zip

Simply set the Virtual Cable as your default microphone, and when prompted by the App select the Virtual Speakers created. (CABLE Input) with the above driver.
